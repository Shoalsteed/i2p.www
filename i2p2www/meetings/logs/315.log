(04:01:46 PM) eyedeekay: Hi everybody
(04:01:50 PM) eyedeekay: welcome to the Tuesday September 6 meeting
(04:02:02 PM) zzz: hi
(04:02:07 PM) mode (-m ) by zzz
(04:02:13 PM) zlatinb: hi
(04:02:26 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi 
(04:02:26 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 1.9.0 release status 
(04:02:26 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 1.10.0 development status
(04:02:26 PM) eyedeekay: 4. next release 2.0.0?                                          
(04:02:26 PM) eyedeekay: 5. Mac arm64 bundle out of beta if 1.9.0 update was successful? (followup from last meeting)                               
(04:02:51 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else to add before we get started?
(04:03:19 PM) eyedeekay: hi zzz, hi zlatinb
(04:03:46 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 1.9.0 release status
(04:05:11 PM) eyedeekay: We released about 2 weeks ago, there was a slight delay getting Android and the Easy-Install bundle out now
(04:05:11 PM) eyedeekay: F-Droid builds are now fixed as well so people who wish to can install from F-Droid main if they choose to and the app will work
(04:05:37 PM) not_bob: Thank you for that.
(04:05:43 PM) eyedeekay: No problem
(04:06:41 PM) eyedeekay: I'm going to be doing a point release for the Windows Easy-Install bundle, zlatinb found a very hard-to-spot bug which sees to affect easy-install bundle on Windows 11 slightly more than other places
(04:07:17 PM) eyedeekay: zzz do you want to talk Debian or anything else?
(04:07:51 PM) zzz: sure
(04:07:53 PM) zzz: about 40% of net is updated which is typical for 2 weeks in
(04:08:10 PM) zzz: we have a few hundred SSU2-enabled routers now, as desired/expected
(04:08:41 PM) zzz: no major issues so far
(04:09:06 PM) zzz: although zlatinb's bug is maybe medium-major :)
(04:09:07 PM) zzz: EOT
(04:10:01 PM) eyedeekay: Yeah and what I don't understand is how it went without happening much for so long, and then it hits the easy bundle twice in quick succession
(04:10:17 PM) zlatinb: well its kind of by accident that I have to use a windows 11 laptop for a few days, it≈õ discovered a lot of issues
(04:11:08 PM) zlatinb: I guess the reseed problem either caused people to try again or give up on i2p off the bat
(04:11:09 PM) zzz: that's usually the way it goes... dev gets new setup... all hell breaks loose
(04:11:59 PM) zlatinb: there is still an unresolved forking issue with firefox on first launch
(04:12:48 PM) zlatinb: so ideally we should try and do something about it
(04:13:30 PM) eyedeekay: Indeed, it only happens the very first time the browser launcher is run, every subsequent time it works fine
(04:13:36 PM) zlatinb: maybe launch headless or play with the launch options, idk
(04:14:10 PM) eyedeekay: Yeah I could launch it headless on the first run, let it fork and close, then subsequently run with the window open
(04:14:58 PM) eyedeekay: That's a good idea thanks zlatinb
(04:15:15 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else on 2?
(04:16:03 PM) goingpostal is now known as Irc2PGuest14444
(04:16:29 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 1.10.0 development status
(04:18:30 PM) eyedeekay: Sorry I'm a little less prepared than usual, stuck in somebody else's office all day, bear with me
(04:21:00 PM) eyedeekay: 2 weeks in, I've been working on a number of improvements to the Windows bundle to make it more stable and intuitive to use and to help track down this clock-skew bug
(04:21:37 PM) eyedeekay: I've also been porting the profile and launcher parts of it(less the jpackaged router) to non-Windows platforms to hopefully provide automatic browser configuration there
(04:22:06 PM) eyedeekay: zzz has been working on SSU2, fixing bugs with the help of orignal, would you like to update us on that zzz
(04:22:16 PM) zzz: yes, thanks. early days, but a summary of changes and fixes so far is at http://zzz.i2p/topics/3377
(04:22:32 PM) zzz: SSU2 - added the ack-immediate flag and connection migration
(04:22:47 PM) zzz: which are the last two things we wanted to get in before enabling for all
(04:24:07 PM) eyedeekay: Cool so you're right on track then?
(04:24:30 PM) zzz: the larger user base has us finding corner cases and more rare bugs, nothing too serious, fixing as we go
(04:24:30 PM) zzz: the plans for months has been for us to enable SSU2 for everybody in the November release and we are still on track
(04:24:30 PM) zzz: EOT
(04:24:42 PM) zzz: yes
(04:24:51 PM) eyedeekay: Awesome thanks for the update
(04:25:09 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else for 3?
(04:25:41 PM) eyedeekay: 4) next release 2.0.0?
(04:25:52 PM) eyedeekay: zzz you added this topic, would you like to get us started?
(04:26:12 PM) zzz: this was a suggestion from dr|z3d so if he's around I'll ask him to make his pitch
(04:26:50 PM) zzz: but if he's not, I'll say it's not a bad idea
(04:27:05 PM) zzz: linux is about to go from 5.19 to 6.0
(04:27:25 PM) zzz: tor's arti just went to 1.0.0
(04:27:26 PM) zzz: ssu2 as good an excuse as any
(04:27:45 PM) RightNow: and I2P is going from SSU to SSU2
(04:27:47 PM) zzz: EOT - thoughts everyone? and we don't need to decide today, we have 11 more weeks
(04:28:30 PM) not_bob: I have no issue with it so long it works.
(04:29:18 PM) zzz: anybody hate it? anybody love it?
(04:29:21 PM) eyedeekay: Sure, I think it makes sense, both transports will have been modernized, it's a big milestone
(04:29:43 PM) zlatinb: I kind of wish we had something bigger of a bang to go to 2.0
(04:29:48 PM) RightNow is now known as RN
(04:30:34 PM) eyedeekay: Use it for 3.0.0 maybe?
(04:30:38 PM) zzz: there's nothing bigger on the roadmap. frankly, I hope we don't ever do anything bigger, I'm tired...
(04:30:56 PM) zlatinb: also I have to leave now sorry, on the last topic yes I think the mac arm bundle is ready to go out of beta.  I will have the windows laptop for another day or two for testing.  Gotta bolt now, sorry
(04:30:59 PM) zlatinb: ttyl
(04:31:05 PM) RN: zzz, you are also thanked.
(04:32:26 PM) eyedeekay: Yes zzz, your dedication and hard work are appreciated
(04:32:34 PM) zzz: tell you what eyedeekay let me post in the 1.10 thread on my forum and will come back next month with a report, stick it on the agenda for next month
(04:32:44 PM) eyedeekay: Will do zzz
(04:33:18 PM) zzz: wasn't trying to elicit thanks, just pointing out this was the last - and hardest - of the crypto migration we've been on for about a decade
(04:33:36 PM) eyedeekay: Didn't need to elicit it, you deserve it :)
(04:33:52 PM) eyedeekay: But point taken, it's a huge effort
(04:33:58 PM) RN: it is a milestone worth celebration, and yeah, you deserve it!
(04:34:14 PM) zzz: if we'd tried to do SSU2 first it would have killed us all. we only managed due to the experience of all the rest of it
(04:34:26 PM) zzz: shared credit to the i2pd project of course
(04:35:01 PM) eyedeekay: Indeed. Back on track though, anything else on 4?
(04:35:15 PM) RN: but you led the charge.
(04:35:21 PM) zzz: if we want to do post-quantum that can be 3.0.0 :)
(04:35:43 PM) eyedeekay: Good idea, that will be exciting
(04:35:53 PM) zzz: nope, nothing else
(04:36:05 PM) eyedeekay: Well 5) was: Mac arm64 bundle out of beta if 1.9.0 update was successful? (followup from last meeting)
(04:36:43 PM) eyedeekay: Which zlatinb gave us a status update for on his way out the door, with the update being successful I see no reason against it
(04:37:38 PM) eyedeekay: Anybody else have anything to add to this topic?
(04:38:06 PM) zzz: I assume zlatinb meant the update worked; if so, he can remove the beta label on the web page
(04:38:32 PM) zzz: that was the only reservation I had at the last meeting
(04:38:33 PM) zzz: eot
(04:39:45 PM) eyedeekay: OK. One of us should ping us when we see him online
(04:39:52 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else for the meeting?
(04:40:04 PM) eyedeekay: ping *him 
(04:41:14 PM) eyedeekay: Well I guess without his git creds I may as well remove the label
(04:41:27 PM) eyedeekay: So I'll do it
(04:41:43 PM) zzz: do you have confirmation the update worked?
(04:42:11 PM) zzz: because he didn't say that above
(04:42:53 PM) eyedeekay: I don't think I do
(04:43:01 PM) eyedeekay: Nope
(04:43:14 PM) eyedeekay: No I've not strictly speaking heard anyone say those exact words yet
(04:43:21 PM) eyedeekay: So I'll wait
(04:43:26 PM) eyedeekay: And ask him
(04:43:32 PM) zzz: ok
(04:44:19 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else for the meeting timeout 1m?
(04:45:44 PM) eyedeekay: All right thanks everyone for coming
