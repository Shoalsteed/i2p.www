(08:01:07 PM) eyedeekay: Hi everybody, sorry I'm late, got disconnected right before the meeting
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi 
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.1.0 Status Report
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.2.0 Development Status 
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Congestion Throttling 
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 5. Hypothetical Traffic Management ( Flood of Tor Users)
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: 6. Stickers for translators
(08:01:59 PM) eyedeekay: zzz where do you want to do your report about the DOS? 2 or own topic?
(08:02:45 PM) zzz: let's call it 3b)
(08:02:46 PM) zzz: or 2b)
(08:02:59 PM) eyedeekay: OK 2b then
(08:03:00 PM) zzz: your choice
(08:03:53 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi who all is here today besides me and zzz?
(08:03:58 PM) zzz: hi
(08:04:09 PM) not_bob: Here
(08:04:18 PM) echelonMAC: here
(08:04:18 PM) obscuratus: Hi
(08:04:29 PM) eyedeekay: Great turnout, thanks everybody
(08:04:30 PM) echelonMAC: on replacement system.
(08:05:06 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.1.0 Status Report
(08:05:15 PM) zzz: irc is laggier than usual so please allow a little extra time for responses
(08:05:38 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks zzz I will keep that in mind
(08:09:02 PM) eyedeekay: Where to even start... my focus has been on Android UX issues in particular fixing up things I was doing wrong when initializing the app
(08:09:04 PM) eyedeekay: Android will get a point release on that account
(08:10:00 PM) eyedeekay: The topic I'm sure is on everybody's mind right now is the network being under attack which has shifted everybody's attention
(08:10:05 PM) eyedeekay: And that is topic 2b
(08:10:59 PM) eyedeekay: Shoot I mixed up the topics, scratch that, that was supposed to go to 3. sorry, long week, lot going on
(08:12:03 PM) eyedeekay: zzz would you do me a favor to take 2? I think I am ill-equipped to present on everything which is going on
(08:12:28 PM) zzz: sure
(08:12:29 PM) zzz: but before I do
(08:12:56 PM) zzz: do you and echelonMAC have a 2.1.0 mac easy-install bundle progress report?
(08:13:17 PM) eyedeekay: Oh yes I can do that
(08:14:38 PM) eyedeekay: So, we've been closing in on issues, and right now echelonMAC and have different hypothesis on what's going on which we're both pursuing
(08:14:38 PM) eyedeekay: My hypothesis is that this all stems from a stale workaround for a bug in Java 14
(08:15:08 PM) eyedeekay: Where jpackage is supposed to sign the dylib files that are packed into a disk image(dmg) but which are in fact left unsigned
(08:15:33 PM) echelonMAC: in short: eyedeekaym did redo the signing script, I can buiodl and sign, but still wrong signing for apple
(08:15:55 PM) eyedeekay: zab worked around this by creating the .app directory and signing the stuff inside it then using jpackage only for the final packaging step
(08:16:35 PM) eyedeekay: so when we upgraded Java's we started signing everything twice, and we no longer needed to do that signing step manually
(08:16:47 PM) eyedeekay: echelonMAC correct me if I'm wrong but you think you have the wrong sort of keys?
(08:17:10 PM) echelonMAC: maybe, maybe not, unsure about that
(08:17:18 PM) echelonMAC: at least the logs showing this error
(08:17:53 PM) zzz: my question was higher level, what's the ETA, is 2.1.0 still a target or has that been abandoned and you're hoping for 2.2.0, or what?
(08:18:15 PM) echelonMAC: 2.1.0 is still the target, but currently no ETA
(08:18:39 PM) echelonMAC: I can build nearly instant, but digging deeper is currently out of time...
(08:18:48 PM) eyedeekay: I still want to cut a release of 2.1.0 as soon as we know we can pass notarization, IMO once we can pass it once we should be able to do it predictably
(08:18:59 PM) zzz: eyedeekay more or less committed to early april 2.2.0 in his blog post, you're not endorsing that ETA echelonMAC ?
(08:19:49 PM) echelonMAC: I am completely helpless and cant predict a ETA, as I do not full yunderstand signing and building yet.
(08:20:12 PM) echelonMAC: more or less, I do follow scripts blindly, if idk can fix the signage, the notarization is a 5 min job.
(08:20:24 PM) echelonMAC: IF the sign does work as appple expect it
(08:20:26 PM) zzz: ok then I recommend an edit of the blog post eyedeekay, let's not promise things we can't deliver on
(08:20:33 PM) eyedeekay: Will do
(08:21:19 PM) zzz: ok thanks you ready for my part of 2) ?
(08:21:41 PM) eyedeekay: Yes please
(08:21:48 PM) zzz: great
(08:22:00 PM) zzz: last meeting was one week after the release, now we're 4 weeks out
(08:22:15 PM) zzz: my hope was that expl. build success would climb steadily
(08:22:35 PM) zzz: from the low-20% to low-30%, and then "pop" out of congestion, back to low 40s
(08:22:45 PM) zzz: only the first part happened
(08:25:20 PM) zzz: and then we swung back and forth between low 20s and low 30s
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: so, we have some theories, see 2b)
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: but I'm happy with the performance of 2.1.0 otherwise
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: not too many bug reports
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: I'll give an overview of what we are fixing in 2b) and 3)
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: about 50% of the network has updated to 2.1.0 or the i2pd equivalent
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: everybody please update if you haven't
(08:26:56 PM) zzz: that's all I have for 2a), but I'll pause for a minute for questions / comments before starting 2b)
(08:28:33 PM) zzz: ok, 2b) current network conditions
(08:28:33 PM) zzz: over the weekend started an unambiguous attack
(08:28:33 PM) zzz: lots of floodfill routers
(08:28:33 PM) zzz: for the most part, the network overall, and java routers, are handling it ok
(08:28:33 PM) zzz: I do have one report of routers crashing with OOM (out of memory)
(08:28:54 PM) zzz: I understand that i2pd routers are really struggling with very low tunnel build success rates
(08:29:06 PM) not_bob: My fleet is up to date.
(08:29:15 PM) zzz: the attack is starting / stopping / changing several times a day
(08:29:37 PM) zzz: so we're only about 60 hours in to understanding it and discussing countermeasures
(08:30:15 PM) zzz: remember the tunnel build problem (now much more likely to be classified as a different attack) started Dec. 19 and took us several weeks to understand and address
(08:30:27 PM) zzz: so it's early days
(08:30:36 PM) not_bob: I have one I2P+ router and it's done well to weather this.  But, my i2pd routers not so much.  I've seen as low as 3% tunnel build success.  I'm currently sitting around 10% on those routers.
(08:31:17 PM) zzz: but this is a straightforward sybil / DHT attack, new to us but familiar to anybody doing peer-to-peer / DHT applications
(08:31:53 PM) zzz: far too early to say if it will require a release ahead of schedule (for java i2p) or if so when
(08:32:23 PM) zzz: EOT, I'll wait a couple minutes for discussion / comments / questions
(08:33:24 PM) eyedeekay: Should people who wind up OOM increase the RAM available to their router?
(08:36:18 PM) zzz: yeah, that's a straightforward mitigation
(08:36:18 PM) zzz: stop your router, edit wrapper.config, restart
(08:36:18 PM) zzz: I expect I'll have mitigations in dev builds in a few days
(08:36:18 PM) dr|z3d: ideally you want your min heap at around 256M and your max ram at 2-3 times that.
(08:36:18 PM) not_bob: I do not currently have any stock I2P routers running.
(08:36:18 PM) zzz: I want to repeat what I said above that the attacks are evolving rapidly, and we want to take our time to address the overall issues
(08:36:18 PM) zzz: not to focus too narrowly on the specifics
(08:37:36 PM) zzz: back to you eyedeekay if there's nothing else on 2b)
(08:38:06 PM) eyedeekay: thanks very much zzz. 3) 2.2.0 Development Status
(08:39:51 PM) eyedeekay: As I mistakenly stated before, my focus has been on Android UX issues in particular fixing up things I was doing wrong when initializing the app, pretty basic stuff all things considered but all of which was due for improvement
(08:39:57 PM) eyedeekay: or outright fixing
(08:40:49 PM) eyedeekay: Examples being fixes for subscriptions and custom ports when building tunnels which got in several user's way after a large increase in users with 2.10
(08:41:07 PM) dr|z3d: as an aside, and to shine some light on the size of the attack, we've got a user reporting ~30K banned routers. so it's non-trivial :)
(08:41:07 PM) dr|z3d: (that'll be shiver, who's here)
(08:42:36 PM) mark22k: I got 56005 banned peers.
(08:42:58 PM) eyedeekay: Holy moley. I have 11027 and I thought that was a lot
(08:43:08 PM) moristo: Is this the work of a nation state--the banned routers or any other noticable patten?
(08:43:50 PM) moristo: Spectrum internet was off yesetrday in FL and Italy the day before.
(08:43:54 PM) moristo: *yesterday.
(08:43:55 PM) zzz: let's get back to 3) please and table further attack discussion until after the meeting
(08:44:05 PM) echelonMAC: Banned Peers (57053)
(08:44:22 PM) moristo: oh, is there a meeting in progress? My bad.
(08:46:50 PM) zzz: eyedeekay, you still with us?
(08:47:11 PM) eyedeekay: yeah I'm here
(08:47:37 PM) zzz: you have more on 3) or is it my turn?
(08:47:37 PM) eyedeekay: started a long one:
(08:47:37 PM) eyedeekay: i2p.firefox(Easy-Install for Windows is also getting worked on, more of the work is being done by removal there, updates are getting simplified now that the old admin-style installs are all migrated to user-style installs
(08:47:37 PM) eyedeekay: portable USB install support is on the horizon for 2.2.0
(08:47:43 PM) eyedeekay: With updates
(08:48:21 PM) eyedeekay: Other issues and user-complaints I'm addressing or deciding how to address are on that issue tracker
(08:48:28 PM) eyedeekay: EOT for me
(08:48:47 PM) zzz: ok you saw the NPE issue in i2p.i2p right?
(08:49:10 PM) eyedeekay: Yes I did, hot on the trail
(08:49:21 PM) zzz: ok holler if you need help ofc
(08:49:24 PM) zzz: 3) for me:
(08:49:47 PM) zzz: I finished the peer selection refactor I've been working on since september, finally
(08:50:31 PM) zzz: I think I fixed the erroneous symmetric nat indications that were in 2.1.0, but need somebody with that problem to test and report
(08:50:59 PM) zzz: got a cool new i2psnark search box
(08:51:19 PM) zzz: almost done with "congestion caps" (proposal 162)
(08:51:31 PM) echelonMAC: :-)
(08:51:49 PM) zzz: and some more tweaks to refine our handling of tunnel build congestion
(08:52:18 PM) zzz: late last week, I thought I was pretty much done with 2.2.0 and could relax for two months until the release
(08:52:31 PM) zzz: so, unfortunately, now we have a lot more to do
(08:52:48 PM) zzz: that's the way it goes sometimes
(08:53:24 PM) not_bob: Thank you for that, a major quality of life improvement.
(08:53:24 PM) zzz: EOT, I'll wait a minute for discussion, then back to you eyedeekay 
(08:53:37 PM) zzz: haha not_bob you're welcome
(08:55:00 PM) eyedeekay: Last call for 3?
(08:55:20 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Congestion Throttling - I think this was a tunnel_king topic, is tunnel_king here?
(08:55:42 PM) zzz: back to you eyedeekay 
(08:57:39 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Congestion Throttling, 5. Hypothetical Traffic Management ( Flood of Tor Users) - both introduced by tunnel_king, last call for tunnel_king
(08:59:01 PM) eyedeekay: OK last one, 6. Stickers for translators
(08:59:01 PM) eyedeekay: Specifically rules for people receiving stickers outside of the Americas
(08:59:58 PM) zzz: this was my topic, only because unresolved since last meeting
(09:00:28 PM) zzz: echelonMAC you have an answer?
(09:00:41 PM) echelonMAC: not en detail, but who wnats should receive a bunch of stickers if they sent their address
(09:01:04 PM) echelonMAC: aka sned a announcement in transifex and send out after receive of address
(09:01:19 PM) echelonMAC: but currently no new stickers arrivced here
(09:01:35 PM) eyedeekay: Tracking says the 10th
(09:01:55 PM) zzz: I'm awaiting echelonMAC to post the instructions on my forum, then I will copy/paste to transifex
(09:02:17 PM) echelonMAC: ok
(09:02:28 PM) zzz: that's where we've been for a month
(09:02:42 PM) zzz: thanks
(09:03:33 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else for 6 or for the meeting?
(09:03:36 PM) zzz: EOT on 6) for me, back to you eyedeekay 
(09:04:32 PM) zzz: one closing word for the meeting: zzz.i2p the best place for news and weather, I'll post there when I know more than I do now
(09:04:32 PM) zzz: thanks
(09:04:55 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks very much for that zzz, and thanks everybody for coming to the meeting
(09:05:44 PM) eyedeekay: See you around IRC and same time next month
(09:08:55 PM) zzz: thanks eyedeekay 
(09:08:55 PM) zzz: got thru it without disconnects
