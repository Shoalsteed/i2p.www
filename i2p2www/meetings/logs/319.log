(08:00:57 PM) eyedeekay: 1. Hi
(08:01:00 PM) eyedeekay: Hi
(08:01:04 PM) zzz: hi
(08:01:29 PM) eyedeekay: tunnel_king are you here for 4 and 5?
(08:02:10 PM) eyedeekay: OK we'll play those by ear for now then
(08:02:21 PM) eyedeekay: 2. 2.1.0 Release Status, 2.1.0 Mac Release Status
(08:03:32 PM) eyedeekay: 2.1.0 release happened yesterday, zzz released the software and the torrent went live, the percentage of the network which has updated has gone up about 7% since then if I'm counting the time correctly(so double check)
(08:04:07 PM) eyedeekay: I released Maven packages the same day, and will have Android updates out on all channels shortly after the end of this meeting
(08:04:29 PM) eyedeekay: Easy-Install for Windows will follow on that, and Easy-Install for Mac will be after that
(08:05:10 PM) eyedeekay: I believe that eche|on has given me the last clue I need to work out our notarization issue, we should know within a few days if that's true, which will correspond to a release
(08:05:30 PM) eyedeekay: Anything to add on the topic zzz?
(08:05:39 PM) zzz: just a little, thanks
(08:06:10 PM) zzz: the i2pd release a week ago looks promising, but that makes looking at the effects of our release a little harder
(08:06:22 PM) zzz: and i2pd plans a point release as early as today
(08:06:56 PM) zzz: so we won't have great info on what our release is doing, but as long as stats keep getting better, that's the main thing
(08:07:06 PM) zzz: far too early to say anything today, maybe in a week
(08:07:08 PM) zzz: EOT
(08:07:23 PM) eyedeekay: Thanks zzz
(08:07:42 PM) eyedeekay: 3. 2.2.0 Development Status
(08:08:52 PM) eyedeekay: I don't have a lot to say on this yet, most of my stuff has remained the same, but I believe we need to agree on a timeline for the release correct?
(08:09:13 PM) zzz: yeah, obviously we haven't done anything on 2.2.0 yet
(08:09:36 PM) zzz: I'd propose a standard 13 week cycle from here, unless we have any huge issues
(08:09:43 PM) eyedeekay: Sounds good to me
(08:09:46 PM) zzz: so that would be a release early April
(08:10:12 PM) aeiou_ is now known as aeiou
(08:10:14 PM) zzz: and put us firmly off our feb/may/aug/nov dates we've been on for several years, oh well
(08:10:40 PM) zzz: but we really need some time to do everything we didn't get to in our last shortened cycle
(08:10:48 PM) zzz: so let's pencil in 13 weeks
(08:10:49 PM) zzz: EOT
(08:11:22 PM) eyedeekay: Yeah, no argument here
(08:11:34 PM) eyedeekay: Plan for early April
(08:12:35 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else on 3?
(08:12:48 PM) eyedeekay: 4. Congestion Throttling and 5. Hypothetical Traffic Management ( Flood of Tor Users) were both added by tunnel_king on zzz.i2p, but I don't see such a name in the room, if you're here under another name, last call
(08:14:08 PM) eyedeekay: Anything else to discuss for the meeting?
(08:15:15 PM) eyedeekay: All right thanks zzz for coming, I promise to set an alarm for the one next month
(08:15:55 PM) zzz: no
(08:16:37 PM) eyedeekay: no nothing else for the meeting or no don't stop the meeting?
(08:16:38 PM) zzz: also I'd like to ask if eche|on is here and has anything to add on 2)
(08:16:38 PM) zzz: nope, that's it, everybody please click your update button to get that 2.1.0 goodness
(08:16:53 PM) zzz: nothing else, thanks
