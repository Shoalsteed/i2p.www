A Reminder to be Safe as I2P Grows
{%- endtrans %}
==================================

{% trans -%}
It is an an exciting time for The Invisible Internet Project (I2P). We
are completing our migration to modern cryptography across all of our
transports, ( Java and C++), and we have recently gained a high-capacity
and professional outproxy service, and there are more applications
integrating I2P based functionality than ever. The network is poised to
grow, so now is a good time to remind everyone to be smart and be safe
when obtaining I2P and I2P-related software. We welcome new
applications, implementations, and forks with new ideas, and the power
of the network comes from its openness to participation by all I2P
users. In fact, we don’t like to call you users, we like to use the word
“Participants” because each of you helps the network, in your own way by
contributing content, developing applications, or simply routing traffic
and helping other participants find peers.

{% trans -%}
You are the network, and we want you to be safe.

We have become aware of attempts to impersonate I2P’s presence on the
web and social media. To avoid offering momentum to these campaigns, we
will not mention the actors affiliated with them, However, in order to
help you recognize these campaigns should you encounter them in the
wild, we are documenting their tactics:
{%- endtrans %}

-  Copying text directly from the I2P Web Site without acknowledging our
   licence requirements in a way that may suggest endorsement.
-  Involvement or promotion of an Intial Coin Offering, or ICO
-  Crypto-Scam like language
-  Graphics that have nothing to do with the textual content
-  Click-farming behavior, sites that appear to have content but which
   instead link to other sites
-  Attempts to get the user to register for non-I2P chat servers. We
   come to you or you come to us, we will not ask you to meet us at a
   third-party service unless you already use it(Note that this is not
   always true for other forks and projects, but it is true of
   geti2p.net).
-  The use of bot networks to amplify any message on social media.
   I2P(geti2p.net) does not use bots for social media advertising.

{% trans -%}
These campaigns have had the side-effect of “shadow-banning” some
legitimate I2P-related discussion on Twitter and possibly other social
media.

These services are hosted by third-parties, sometimes corporations,
where we participate in order to provide a social media outreach
presence to I2P users who choose to participate in them. We will never
ask you to participate in these unless you already have an account with
them, prior to interacting with us.
