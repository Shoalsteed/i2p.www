<h2>Tor / Onion Routing</h2>
<i><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">[Tor]</a> 
   <a href="http://www.onion-router.net">[Onion Routing]</a></i>
<p>{% trans netdb=site_url('docs/how/network-database'), peerselection=site_url('docs/how/peer-selection') -%}
Tor and Onion Routing are both anonymizing proxy networks, 
allowing people to tunnel out through their low latency mix 
network. The primary differences between Tor / 
Onion-Routing and I2P are 
threat model and out-proxy design, though Tor
supports hidden services as well. In addition, Tor
takes the directory-based approach, providing a 
centralized point to manage the overall view of the 
network, and gather and report statistics. This is different from I2P's distributed <a href="{{ netdb }}">network 
database</a> and <a href="{{ peerselection }}">peer selection</a>.

<p>{% trans -%}
Outproxy functionality has some  
substantial weaknesses against certain attackers. For instance, 
once communication leaves a mixnet, 
adversaries can more easily mount traffic analysis. In 
addition, outproxies have access to the cleartext 
of the data transferred in both directions, and 
outproxies are prone to abuse, along with  
other security issues associated with 
regular Internet traffic.

<p>{% trans -%}
It's not always productive to compare Tor and I2P directly, because they are intended to accomplish things in somewhat different ways.

I2P is a peer-to-peer network where every participant has exactly the same "status" within the network, more-or-less. This is in contrast to Tor which has a clear separation of "Clients" "Routers" and "Exits" with sub-categories within. In I2P, everyone is a "Client" and a "Router" and no one is an "Exit."
The I2P network is not designed to exit traffic. Instead it is designed to be used as an internal, internet-like overlay network.

Almost any application can run over the I2P network with enough effort. Things that involve knocking a TCP service to open a UDP service are possible on I2P in ways that are not immediately possible on Tor.

On the other hand, Tor was designed with egress in mind. Exit nodes are official services, and Tor has defences designed around traffic confirmation by the exit node. The Tor Browser Bundle has made Tor much easier to use, and it has benefitted from extensive development, code review, and user facing design. This makes Tor better for accessing a clearnet website than using I2P's outproxy function.

I2P network use-cases are much broader. Instead, the project ships a "Router Console" along with accompanying applications such as Bittorrent and email. These applications are pre-configured for I2P network use. The result is that I2P provides a broader use case end-user console UX that can seem confusing due to presenting the complexity of options.
