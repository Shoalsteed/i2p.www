<h1>{{ _('Mac OS DMG Bundle') }}</h1>
<p>{% trans -%}
We are excited to offer you a DMG bundle for Mac OS.  It installs and behaves
the same way many other Mac OS applications do and does not require a Java
Runtime Environment to be available.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans perf="https://i2pgit.org/i2p-hackers/i2p-jpackage-mac/-/issues/1" -%}
This bundle is built for <code>x86_64(Intel)</code> Macs. It will run on
<code>ARM(M1)</code> Macs in emulated mode, but the performance is unknown. M1 Mac
users should report results to us at the <a href="{{ perf }}">Gitlab Repository</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{{ _('How do I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
Double-Click on the .dmg file, which you may download from this page. When a
window appears with the I2P application inside it, "drag" the application to the
"Applications" side of the window to install it. Once you're finished, I2P is
installed and can be launched from Finder. This procedure is the same as any
other Mac application. When you launch I2P, the I2P icon will appear on the Dock
and a few seconds later a browser will open with the I2P console page, inviting
you to complete the bandwidth setup wizard.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<p>{% trans browser="https://geti2p.net/htproxyports" -%}
If you want to browse hidden websites ('eepsites') on the I2P network, you need
to configure your browser. Instructions for configuring a range of browsers are
available on <a href="{{ browser }}">the browser configuration
page</a>.
{%- endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{{ _('Why should I use it?') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
Two important reasons, 1) because this package is a .dmg, it can be signed with
a certificate which will be recognized by your computer. This means that your
computer can automatically make sure that you've obtained I2P from the I2P
Project, rather than a potentially altered or "fake" installer, and 2) because
it makes I2P easier to install and work with on Apple computers by using tools
that are familiar and built-into the operating system.

Download that file and double-click on it.  Accept the License Agreement, then
drag the <code>I2P</code> icon on top of the <code>Applications</code> icon.
Launch I2P from Finder.

<h2>{{ _('Limitations') }}</h2>
<p>{% trans -%}
I2P will not install any launch agents on your Mac.  If you want I2P to start on
system startup, you need to configure a launch agent yourself. You can configure
I2P to launch when your user logs in by right-clicking on the I2P Dock icon.
